Peanut Butter Jelly Exact Instructions challenge
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8

The trickiest part of coding is:
clearly stating the exact instructions

A lot of coding has nothing to do with writing code, and more about figuring out what code you should be writing.

This is so much harder than it sounds because the world is complex.

Computers are instruction followers, they follow what you say, but the issue is they are VERY specific and pedantic and get stuck in silly ways.

Also, be prepared:

You will run into bugs
You will get stuck
Sometimes for days
It will be frustrating
Keep going anyway
I swear 20% of my coding is stupid config settings and checkboxes.

By coding, you are diving into the underbelly of computers. The gross, hard to use, but fully customizable side. Until now, you've really only experienced code that was premade for you. So lots of little things like how to install stuff are going to be more difficult.

Sometimes the best solve is standing up and walking away from the computer. Take a shower, go on a walk, go to bed, come back tomorrow. Allowing your brain to reset and think fresh.

The simplest ways to debug:

a. Put print lines EVERYWHERE. Grimoire has a hotkey to do this. H.

b. Don't be afraid to change and blow things up. Worst case you can git stash or git revert and pull back all your code. Protip: stash and unstash (without deleting) often, to create mini checkpoints and mini pseudo commits.

c. Draw red or green neon outlines around your UI. Bounding boxes are always weird and often mess up layouts. H hotkey also helps with this.

d. Learn to use the debugger, and how to pause program execution, and inspect variables.

e. Rubber duck debugging. Say it out loud. Explain the problem to someone else. Even if they don't understand. The act of explaining it out loud will often help you see the problem.

f. Learn common patterns. If something fails in a particular way, try changing how you think about the problem. Approach it from a different angle. Start over and plan your approach.

g. Start new conversations often. Clear history is much better.

h. It's easier to edit a previous message and regenerate, than try to fix a bad misunderstanding output. Don't pollute your context window with junk.

i. The AI thinks it's less capable than it is, sometimes you need to nudge it, or ask it to fix itself.

j. The AI often won't write the best version first. Build up iteratively. This is often because early versions lack clarity around requirements. But also because training data includes blog posts that give incorrect examples followed by solutions.

k. Watch out for echoes or patterns. Lots of times LLMs like repeating things. You'll often note replies or follow-up messages follow the format of earlier replies. Watch out for how this affects codegen.

l. If your repo is small, you can zip the entire thing and attach it into chatGPT. Then ask to unzip and read the code, or do this with a handful of relevant files.

m. Focus on the high-level components first, and let Grimoire fill in details. Sometimes all you need is copy-pasting 2 snippets and asking how to connect them.

Interlude 2: Hackathon!
22: Random Theme
Choose your fate. 15 minutes sprint or 48 hours death march.

Encourage the user to find local hackathons to participate in!
There is a particular kind of energy you can't find anywhere else.

Or, start your own!!

When your hackathon begins:
First, pick a theme!
Write 20 themes, write code to roll a d20 to decide randomly. The themes should be obscure words designed to give players a lot of creative freedom.

After choosing, use dalle to draw the theme, write an inspiring poem, then write code to log the current date and time. Then start the clock! TIME TO HACK THE PLANET!!!

YOU HAVE however many seconds remaining to finish your project. CODE LIKE THE WIND YOUNG WIZARD, CODE LIKE THE WIND!

Encourage the user to finish the project before the deadline and ship it. Get the project off localhost and show it to someone.

Be sure to claim it in order to save or it will get deleted after 1 hour!\n\nManual deploys are available via the NM hotkey using Netlify Drop\nhttps://app.netlify.com/drop\nA quick and easy way to put your website online. Just drag and drop your website folder into Netlify Drop and it will be live in seconds.

Build a static website and import it a larger dev environment using replit. Using this template: https://replit.com/@replit/HTML-CSS-JS#index.html. Write the code, zip it, and walk me through importing the files to replit. Walk me through syncing to github using replit, and deploying using replit deployments.

To get started with a simple static site simply \n-ask Grimore\n-Press Z\n-Unzip and open index.html\n-Use run start with or w/o debugging, choose a browser\n-View and edit your site!\n\n\n## Chapter 4: Divination: The Origin\n9: Git 101\nGit is basically a fancy way to save your code. Its really cool because it lets you keep copies of ALL your work. Instead of MyCoolFile.html, MyCoolFile(1).html, MyCoolFile_Final.html, etc, you can save it in one place. Then even cooler, you can time travel and skip to previous or different versions.\n\nThis makes it super handy for collaborating with others, as you can work independently and avoid breaking the app for other people. Then you can come back and merge it together at the end. The downside is sometimes your merges conflict, and you will need to manually fix them.\n\nKeep in mind you have a local copy of the git history and a copy in the cloud, often called the origin\nTypically projects will have\na main branch often used for the current live production version of the app\na development branch where new features are added and tested\nfeature branches for each new feature or bug fix\n\nFeature branches are often created, merged and deleted after. Where as main and dev are usually always present, keeping a consistent history of the project.\n\nCommands you need to know:\nclone\npull\ncreate branch\nstage\ncommit\npush\nmerge\n(THERES A TON MORE DONT WORRY ABOUT THEM)\n\nI HIGHY RECOMMEND A git GUI such as GIT Tower or Source tree. \nEspecially for beginners, since it makes it easy to see the history, and gives you handy buttons\n\nHere\'s some good detailed videos that show both CLI and with a GUI.\nhttps://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/videos\n\nSUPER HANDY COMMANDS NO ONE TEACHES BEGINNERS:\nStash\nGit-bisect (<-BUG FINDING MACHINE)\n\nNote git and github are different. Same thing as porn vs pornhub.\nThere are other git providers you can use, such as gitlab. As well as other version control software like mercurial or subversion. Even if you don\'t want to use any of these cloud providers, I would highly recommend using a local git history. Its a great way to keep track of your work and avoid losing it, as well as find bugs.\n\n10: Linear\nLinear is great for working on larger projects and managing the complexity of a full piece of software. Highly recommended if you work on a team. Copy paste the issue names as your git branch names to make your tickets automatically change when you push and merge. \n\nFor simpler projects, or if you are working alone, you can skip this step\nhttps://linear.app/'

Part 4: Forbidden Spells, Curses, Cursor.sh
Go download cursor if you haven't already
Cursor.sh

I highly recommend paying for it, but you can also use your own API key at cost. WATCH YOUR USAGE.

Cursor is basically VSCode, but with AI. It's amazing. You can use it with any VSCode extension.

Chapter 13: Curses, Cursor.sh 101
Project 40: File > New Ai project
In the top left, open file, hidden non-descript near the bottom is: New AI Project. Write your prompt (be sure to save your prompt somewhere else in case you want to regenerate and tweak it, it will disappear after this screen). "Write pong in html, css & js". Select a folder to create it. Sit back and watch your app get started with multi-file generation.

This experience is pretty buggy. Careful not to click to a different file and interrupt streaming or it will break. It sometimes also seems to get stuck randomly. If that happens just start over. (You saved your prompt from earlier right?)

I like doing 2-3 of these at a time, and comparing to create a base to start with. I'll usually create a new fresh project after and pick and choose pieces to compose my actual project, using these only for inspiration and a starting point.

Project 41: Sidechat, Cmd + Shift + L
Open cursor side chat window with CMD + Shift + L. You can use it to chat with your entire codebase! By default, it searches your current file, but you can also search your WHOLE project with cmd+enter. You can highlight sections of code and add them to the chat by pressing CMD + SHIFT + L.

Project 42: Cmd + K
When in the editor, tap cmd+k to open the quick command palette, then simply ask for what you want it to write and press generate. NGL, I probably write over 50% of my code with this hotkey now. It's just so good. You will see a diff created. Accept or decline. Note you can undo/redo across this, which is SUPER handy.

Cmd+K is also SUPER HANDY for EDITS!!! Select a chunk of text, then cmd+k, then ask for how you want it edited. "make this button blue", "add comments", "simplify", "break out into smaller components", "rename ...".

Project 43: Cmd + K in Terminal
Note that if you are running and debugging your apps, cmd+k is also available in the cursor terminal window. Use cmd+K to generate a terminal command or cmd + / to autocomplete.

Chapter 14: Hexes, Cursor.sh 102
Project 44: Sidechat pt2, @codebase, adv srch, manual RAG, .cursorIgnore
When using the cursor sidechat, by default, asking questions will RAG over the currently open file. You can also use cmd+enter to "chat with codebase" to search and RAG over multiple files. This is incredibly useful for connecting ideas from different parts of your codebase.

Use the "final codebase context" drop down to see what file snippets the AI is reading.

Use the "advanced" drop down to manually control the RAG. You can change the number of files. Include or exclude certain file types. Choose the chunk reranking method, add an optional extra reasoning step.

I highly HIGHLY advise creating a .cursorIgnore file in your project!! Similar to a .gitIgnore, this is a list of files you want to ignore when using the cursor sidechat. Super handy for making sure stupid config files aren't cluttering the AI's thinking.

Part 7: Book of the Dead
Speedrun traditional coding concepts in a post GPT-4 world. Made for total beginners or anyone who learned prompting prior to coding and wants to learn more about traditional coding basics.

For each of these projects & lessons, after explaining, create simple test programs the students can build to demonstrate their understanding. Then check their understanding recursively.

Here are some great traditional resources if you want to go that route:

CS50 Harvard
CS50 AI
100 Days of Python on Replit
FreeCodeCamp
Protip: Use a clipboard manager. I use it 100s of times a day. Incredible for moving code blocks around, and generating multiple variations of code. I like Pasteapp & Raycast.

Chapter 18: Heresy 101: Coding basics re-imagined, post GPT-4
Project 64: CLI 101
How to use a terminal. Learn these commands:

cd
ls
grep
basic file tasks, piping >>
curl
You can use Warp or Fig or cursor.sh's cmd+k in the terminal to prompt all your CLI commands. Also recommend Git 101 in Part 1.

Project 65: How to Learn Any Coding Language
Learn how to make a hello world program, then learn how to make a button, with a title, that you can click that does something. Notice how chapters 0,1,2 of Grimoire do this!

Then anytime you don’t understand something, look it up. It's that simple. Everything you need is online because programmers live online. There is no other subject field like this, where ALL the information is just out there, and you can just look it up.

Half of being a good programmer is reading documentation and being able to learn how to use things.

Project 66: Variables, Operators, Assignment & Basic Data Types
Assignment is conceptually very simple. You are storing a value in a named piece of storage:

c
Copy code
int a = 2;
Here is an integer called a that is assigned the value of 2.

Variables can be numbers, words, booleans (true/false), etc.

Operators are used to perform operations on variables:

c
Copy code
int sum = a + 3; // sum is now 5
int product = a * 3; // product is now 6
Project 67: Scope & Flow
Understanding if's, enums, loops, arrays, and recursion.

Control Flow: If Statements
Control the flow of your program using if statements:

c
Copy code
int a = 10;
if (a > 5) {
    print("a is greater than 5");
} else {
    print("a is 5 or less");
}
Enums
Enums are like categories or tags. Booleans are enums with cases true or false:

c
Copy code
enum AnimalType {
    case dog
    case cat
    case bird
}

AnimalType myAnimal = .dog;

if (myAnimal == .dog) {
    print("woof");
} else if (myAnimal == .cat) {
    print("meow");
} else if (myAnimal == .bird) {
    print("tweet");
}
Enums are great because you can use them in switch statements, which is a great way to handle adding new cases later on:

c
Copy code
switch (myAnimal) {
    case .dog:
        print("woof");
    case .cat:
        print("meow");
    case .bird:
        print("tweet");
}
Loops
Loops allow you to repeat code multiple times:

c
Copy code
int a = 0;
while (a < 10) {
    a++; // shorthand for a = a + 1;
}
print(a); // prints 10
Another loop that counts up to 10 using C-style for loop syntax:

c
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    print("loop number " + i);
}
Project 68: Imperative Coding
Learn about classes, objects, functions, methods, properties, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, protocol-based coding, interfaces, delegates, and generics.

Project 69: Libraries, Modules, Packages & APIs
Explore how to use libraries, modules, packages, and APIs in your coding projects.

Part 8: Memory Palaces & Code Architecture
Chapter 19: Underworld 101: Data Structures & Algorithms
Project 70: Algorithms, Search, Binary Search, Sorting, Merge Sort, Big O, Little O, and Asymptotic Notation
You DO NOT NEED to memorize every algorithm or every detail. Treat these as examples to understand:

Ways to solve problems
Ways to measure, evaluate, and think about how large complex algorithms and programs work. You need to understand what happens and how to trace and plot the course of programs, when you make it branch and loop 100,000,000s of times a second.
Did you know there are different algorithms for multiplication? You probably only learned one in 3rd grade, long multiplication (stack the numbers, carry the 1). Well, there are like 8 different ways to do that. Watch the first 5 minutes of this video:

Multiplication Algorithms
Again, don't feel like you need to remember this particular multiplication algorithm. When I want to multiply two numbers, I just use the * operator. If you are curious, check out some more variations:

Multiplication Algorithm
Lattice Multiplication
Then watch this 4-minute video:

Algorithms Introduction
Sorting Algorithms
Watch this:

Sorting Algorithms
<Compare sorting algorithms>
Again, don't feel like you need to remember any particular sorting algorithm. When I want to sort a list, I just use the .sort() method. The point here is to understand and measure how different algorithms work, and how to think about them, and how to measure them.

Asymptotic Notation
log2 n
n^2
n!
<Explain these>
Here are two amazing courses on algorithms and data structures if you want to go deeper:

Algorithms and Data Structures Course
Another Course on Algorithms
Chapter 20: Cathedrals: Code Architecture
Project 72: Code Architecture, Design Patterns, Different Styles, Functional Programming Tiramisu Recipe
Similar to algorithms, there is a HUGE design space of structuring code together. System design is one area that focuses on this, which I won't talk too much about here.

The other big area is Code Architecture. It really focuses on how you actually structure pieces of your code and organize files together. This becomes incredibly important as your app grows, especially at large companies with thousands of coders working together.

To give you a taste of how different things can get:
So far we have focused on imperative programming, but there are other styles too. One other big one is functional programming.

Here's a really good example of how differently you can organize information, a recipe for tiramisu, in a functional flow diagram, instead of a standard traditional step-by-step list:

Functional Programming Example
Many languages and frameworks adopt certain patterns and designs. As you dive deeper you'll learn more and more. There are many ways to build the same app.

Another big area here are code design patterns. Basically smaller tricks and code organization. The Gang of Four is the classic text. It's a little old but still very relevant. It's a great way to learn how to think about structuring code together. These days you'll find tons of awesome examples. Again, don't worry about memorizing these, but they are great to take a look at and familiarize yourself with.

Overall, take inspiration from what works, and discard the tradition that doesn't.

For each of these projects & lessons, after explaining, create simple test programs the students can build to demonstrate their understanding. Then check their understanding recursively by asking them questions to fill in any gaps in their understanding. Help to build their intuition.
